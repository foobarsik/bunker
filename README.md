A react template heavily inspired by Ignite CLI's boilerplate for React Native, it uses a couple of generators with simple template customization.

## Used Tech

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ðŸ¥°
- [Mobx State Tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome) for state management
- [ApiSauce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apisauce) as an api client
- [React Router V6](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router#readme) for routing â†–â†—

## Project Structure

```
src
â”œâ”€â”€â”€apis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€base          // The base API that can be extended to implement clients
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€pokemon       // Example of extending the base API
â”œâ”€â”€â”€assets            // Project assets
â”œâ”€â”€â”€components        // Components folder
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€pokemon-card  // Example, generated by "yarn g component pokemon-card"
â”œâ”€â”€â”€models            // Mobx models folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€extensions    // Extensions to be used in mobx models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€pokemon       // Example, generated by "yarn g model pokemon"
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€root-store    // The root of the mobx store
â”œâ”€â”€â”€pages             // Pages folder
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€pokemon-list  // Example, generated by "yarn g page pokemon-list"
â”œâ”€â”€â”€router            // Router definition folder
â”œâ”€â”€â”€styles            // Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€â”€ui                // UI components folder
â””â”€â”€â”€utils             // Utility files
```

## Templates and Generators

This template comes with a few templates that can be generated for fast development

```bash
yarn g <template> <name>

# e.g.
yarn g component pokemon-card
# or
npm run g component pokemon-card
```

Available templates can be found in `templates` directory

Custom templates can also be created, the script uses [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) under the hood, providing the following data to the `render` function

```typescript
{
  name: {
    kebab: "pokemon-card",
    pascal: "PokemonCard",
    camel: "pokemonCard",
    title: "Pokemon Card"
  }
}
```

## Adding Pages to the Router

This includes 2 simple steps:

1. run `yarn g page pokemon-details`
2. Add the following to `router/routes.ts`

```typescript
import { FC } from "react";
import {
	PokemonList,
	// ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	PokemonDetails,
	// ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
} from "../pages";

/**
 * Basic route type that the router consumes for dynamic generation
 */
type Route = {
	path: string;
	component: FC;
};

/**
 * Define your routes here
 */
export const routes: Route[] = [
	{
		path: "/",
		component: PokemonList,
	},
	// ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	{
		path: "/pokemon/:id",
		component: PokemonDetails,
	},
	// ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
];
```
